## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data  <- read.csv("activity.csv")
data1  <- subset(data, !is.na(steps))
data2  <- data.frame(steps=data1$steps, date=data1$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(reshape2)
table  <- aggregate(data2$steps, by = list(data2$date), FUN = sum)
hist(table$x, main = "Histogram Total Steps per Day", xlab = "Total Steps Per Day")
```
# Mean
mean  <- mean(table$x)
# Median
median  <- median(table$x)





## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
